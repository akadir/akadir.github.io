    <h3>2. A Pragmatic Approach</h3>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">2.8. Orthogonality</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <h4>What Is Orthogonality?</h4>
      In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or more things
      are
      orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. In a well-designed system, the
      database
      code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can change the interface without affecting the
      database, and swap databases without changing the interface.

    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">2.13. Estimating</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <h4 style="text-align: center">Where Do Estimates Come From?</h5>
        All estimates are based on models of the problem. But before we get too deeply into the techniques of
        building models, we have to mention a basic estimating trick that always gives good answers: ask
        someonewho’s already done it.

    <h3>4. Pragmatic Paranoia</h3>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <p>...</p>
      But Pragmatic Programmers take this a step further. They don’t trust themselves, either. Knowing that no
      one
      writes perfect code, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers code in defenses against their own
      mistakes. We describe the first defensive measure in Design by Contract: clients and suppliers must agree on
      rights and responsibilities.

    <div style="padding: 0.5em 0 0.5em 0"></div>

    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">4.21. Design by Contract</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      What is a correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims to do. Documenting and verifying
      that claim is the heart of Design by contract(DBC, for short).

    <div style="padding: 0.5em 0 0.5em 0"></div>

    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <p>Subclasses must be usable through the base class interface without the need for the user to know the
        difference.</p>

      <p>In other words, you want to make sure that the new subtype you have created really “is-a-kind-of” the
        base
        type—that it supports the same methods, and that the methods have the same meaning.</p>

    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">4.24. When to Use Exceptions?</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <h5>What Is Exceptional?</h5>

      “Will this code still run if I remove all the exception handlers?” If the answer is “no,” then maybe
      exceptions are being used in nonexceptional circumstances.

    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">4.25. How to Balance Resources?</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      It doesn’t matter what kind of resources we’re using—transactions,memory, files, threads, windows—the basic
      pattern applies: whoever allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it. However,in some
      languages we can develop the concept further.

    <h3>6. While You Are Coding</h3>
    <h4 style="padding-left: 2em;">6.31 Programming by Coincidence</h4>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center">
      <h4>How to Program by Coincidence</h4>
      <p>Suppose Fred is given a programming assignment. Fred types in some code, tries it, and it seems to work.
        Fred types in some more code, tries it, and it still seems to work. After several weeks of coding this
        way, the program suddenly stops working, and after hours of trying to fix it, he still doesn’t know why.
        Fred may well spend a significant amount of time chasing this piece of code around without ever being
        able to fix it. No matter what he does, it just doesn’t ever seem to work right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fred doesn’t know why the code is failing because he didn’t know why
        it worked in the first place. It seemed to work, given the limited “testing”
        that Fred did, but that was just a coincidence. Buoyed by false confi-
        dence, Fred charged ahead into oblivion. Now, most intelligent people
        may know someone like Fred, but we know better. We don’t rely on
        coincidences—do we?

      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we might. Sometimes it can be pretty easy to confuse a
        happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.

      <h4>Implicit Assumptions</h4>

      Coincidences can mislead at all levels—from generating requirements through to testing. Testing is
      particularly fraught with false causalities and coincidental outcomes. It’s easy to assume that X causes Y,
      but as we said in Debugging, page 90: don’t assume it, prove it.

      <b>How Do You Refactor?</b>
      <p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
          <li> Don’t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time. </li>
          <li> Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible.
            That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything. </li>
          <li> Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, fuse two similar methods
            into a superclass. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a
            larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid
            prolonged debugging.</li>
